The miniboss is named the Forgotten Guardian, which you are required to kill to obtain the materials to craft the pickaxe to progress to the next dimension above, the nether. The Forgotten Guardian is found in the catacombs and is very tanky, hits hard but is also very slow,"

The Dead King is a spellcasting based boss and has two stages, upon his health reaching zero, he will revive and replenish 50% of his health bar in an enraged state and will utilise much more destructive magic to end you."
